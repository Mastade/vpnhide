//! Minimal FFI bindings for ByteDance's android-inline-hook (shadowhook).
//!
//! Upstream: <https://github.com/bytedance/android-inline-hook>
//!
//! We only bind the three entry points we actually need. shadowhook itself
//! is linked as a static archive (`libshadowhook.a`) built for
//! `aarch64-linux-android`; see `build.rs`.
